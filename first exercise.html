						<p> While I am excited to learn HTML and coding in general, this is very new and foreign to me. I don't even know if it has spelling check. Just trying to make this look longer than it actually is now. Nothing important, just typing away. It's 7.37pm on October 14, 2015. <span>Kind of hot, kind of tired, probably drank too much <strong><em>coffee</em></strong> such that I don't feel too well.</span>
